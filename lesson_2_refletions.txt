What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Creates meta directory .git

This is where the commit history, change descriptions, will reside.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?What value do you think it offers?

It contains only a subset of the file in the working directory. These are the files to be added permenantly to the repository.

Seems like I can hold off from commiting until I reach a milestone.
