When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	If I did not have access to a private computer and had to resort to a public computer. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	If I understand the question, I definitely would prefer manual pulls to prevent overwriting a local version that was uncommitted. I would want to know what was in the local directory, and manually pulling would ensure that.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	A fork is a clone of a repository, but it is performed in GitHub.
	A clone is a copy of a repository to a local computer.
	A branch is a separate copy of a local repository.

	If I was working alone, I would clone to my local computer. 
	If I was working in a team, I'd fork and setup others to access the repository in GitHub.
	If I was experimenting, working on a bug fix, adding new functionality, I would create branch on local repository.
